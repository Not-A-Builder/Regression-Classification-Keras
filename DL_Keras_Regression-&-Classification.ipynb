    "\n",
    "We have 10 nodes in each of our input layers. This number can also be in the hundreds or thousands. Increasing the number of nodes in each layer increases model capacity. I will go into further detail about the effects of increasing model capacity shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Activation' is the activation function for the layer. An activation function allows models to take into account nonlinear relationships. For example, if you are predicting diabetes in patients, going from age 10 to 11 is different than going from age 60â??61.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation function we will be using is ReLU or Rectified Linear Activation. Although it is two linear pieces, it has been proven to work well in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer needs an input shape. The input shape specifies the number of rows and columns in the input. The number of columns in our input is stored in 'n_cols'. There is nothing after the comma which indicates that there can be any amount of rows.\n",

    "The last layer is the output layer. It only has one node, which is for our prediction.\n",

    "The optimizer controls the learning rate. We will be using 'Adam' as our optimizer. Adam is generally a good optimizer to use for many cases. The Adam optimizer adjusts the learning rate throughout training.\n",

    "The learning rate determines how fast the optimal weights for the model are calculated. A smaller learning rate may lead to more accurate weights (up to a certain point), but the time it takes to compute the weights will be longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our loss function, we will use 'mean_squared_error'. It is calculated by taking the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It is a popular loss function for regression problems. The closer to 0 this is, the better the model performed.\n",
